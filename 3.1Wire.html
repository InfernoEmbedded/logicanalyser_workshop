	<h1>1Wire</h1>
	<p>1Wire is a simple, low bandwidth protocol that allows a number of devices to be installed on a bus consisting of a single wire pair. Devices may be
		parasitically powered from the bus, or powered independently. Communication on the bus is entirely driven from the master. The bus is held high via a pull-up
		resistor, and the master & slave devices can pull the bus low via a transistor. Data is communicated via pulse length, which means that 1wire is a timing
		senstive protocol.</p>

	<p>
		In this exercise, we will set up the microcontroller as a 1Wire master, and we will use a <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf">Maxim
			DS18B20</a> temperature sensor as a slave. We will use a cut-down version of an open sourced 1wire library to communicate with the device. Once we have verified
		that we can read the sensor, we will move on to a broken implementation of the library, and debug it with the use of the logic analyser and the <a
			href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf">DS18B20 datasheet</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Setup</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Locate your temperature sensor is your parts kit, it should have a cylindrical metal body and a wire tail with black, red & yellow wires.</li>
		<li><span class="floatright"><a href="images/connect_ds18b20-1.jpg"><img style="float: right; clear: right;" src="images/connect_ds18b20-1.jpg"
                    height="153" width="213" /></a></span>Connect the 3 wires into an unused area of your breadboard. It may help to insert all 3 wires simultaneously.</li>
		<li>Connect the black wire to the Ground (-) rail on your breadboard with a jumper wire.</li>
		<li>Connect the red wire to +5V on your USB->TTL adapter.</li>
		<li>Connect the yellow wire to pin A7 of the microcontroller.</li>
		<li>Connect the 4.7kOhm resistor between the red and yellow wires of the temperature sensor.</li>
		<li><a href="https://os.mbed.com/compiler/#import:/users/deece/code/stm32f103c8t6-ds18b20/">Import the DS18B20 sample</a> into your compiler.</li>
		<li>Compile the project, and upload it to your board.</li>
		<li>Connect to the serial port (if you are not already connected), you should see something similar to the following:<br> <code>
				Found DS18B20: 28:ff:9d:e9:a2:17:04:93<br> Initiating temperature conversion<br> Scratchpad=e1:10:0c:ff:7f:46:4b:01:82<br> Checksum is good<br>
				It is 24.125C<br>
			</code> If you don't, double check that the device is connected as per the wiring instructions above. Here are a few symptoms you may see:<br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Problem</th>
					<th>Resolution</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>No unassigned DS1820 found!</td>
					<td>Double check that the yellow wire is connected to pin A7</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Temperature reads 85&deg;C</td>
					<td>Ensure the 4.7k resistor is installed between +5V and the yellow wire</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Temperature reads very high</td>
					<td>Double check that the red wire is connected to +5V and not +3.3V</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<li>Move Channel 1/D0 to the yellow wire of the temperature sensor.</li>
		<li>Set up a falling edge trigger on Channel 1, and clear any other triggers you may have. Set a pre-trigger capture ratio of 5%.</li>
		<li>Add a "1-Wire Link Layer" stack decoder.</li>
		<li>Configure the new decoder to use Channel 1/D0 as the 1wire signal line, then click on "Stack Decoder" in the bottom right, and add "1-Wire Network
			Layer" decoder to it.</li>
		<li>Configure a sample rate of 500kHz, and 1M samples.</li>
		<li>Start an acquisition, and press the "Reset" button on the microcontroller (next to the yellow jumpers) to start a new transaction with the
			temperature sensor.</li>
		<li>Follow the recorded transaction along with the <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf">DS18B20 datasheet</a> and the code
			to understand what each step of the communication does. You should be able to identify the following:<ul>
			<li>Reset & Presense pulses.</li>
			<li>ROM commands & data, SEARCH_ROM & MATCH_ROM.</li>
			<li>DS18B20 function commands, CONVERT_TEMPERATURE, READ_SCRATCHPAD.</li>
			<li>The scratchpad contents, and verify that they match what is printed out on the serial port.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Debugging</h2>
	<p>Now that you have seen a successful transaction, let's load up some broken code and use the analyser to debug it.<br>
	Note: Depending on your prior experience, this section may be quite challenging. Go at your own pace, I'll be sticking around afterwards for assistance, or you may contact me via Twitter (@EvilDeece) or email (alastair@d-silva.org).</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Import the <a href="https://os.mbed.com/compiler/#import:/users/deece/code/stm32f103c8t6-ds18b20-broken/">broken project</a> into your compiler,
			compile and upload it. All the bugs are in DS18B20.cpp.
		</li>
		<li>The first problem to fix is that the temperature sensor is not detected. Look at the Reset/Presense pulse section of the waveform, and determine how
			it differs from the requirements described in the datasheet. Fix the problem.</li>
		<li>The second problem is that the chip does not appear to be selected properly. Investigate the second and third sections of the waveform, and fix the problem.</li>
		<li>For the third problem, take a few readings. Try warming the sensor in your hands and taking another reading. What do you expect should happen? How do you expect the device to behave if a temperature conversion was not requested? Investigate the second waveform and fix the problem.</li>
		<li>For the last problem, take a few readings. Do the readings make sense? With the data dump of the scratchpad, work a temperature conversion by hand, and compare it to the result reported. Can you now fix the problem?</li>
		<li>If you get stuck, ask your neighbours for a hint, but if all else fails, you can always view the revision history of the broken project to see what errors were introduced.</li>
